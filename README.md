This is the GitHub repository where my website's (kingofevryfing.com) files are saved for anyone to use if you want. (You really will only use it if you are a beginner).
I coded it all myself, didn't copy and paste any code from anywhere else but i did look to others for inspiration.
I do plan on updating my website every once and a while.
